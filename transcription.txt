I have the great pleasure to live in Spain for two years in Spain when you come into a shop the cashier's replies it looks a little bit and you feel very much welcome and then I said hi call trenice much about greetings it's about how you do it and when you do it I was born and raised in a French speaking part of Canada and lightened up part of the world like in many other places around the world when you leave an event or you leave a party or going to go around and say goodbye to everyone so we're going to go around and shake hands with every man and kissed every women it's expected its welcome it's part of the cultural rituals and Norms actually if you don't do this you will feel a little bit uneducated if you do this in Scandinavia your weird why would you go and disturb someone in the middle of a conversation just to say goodbye when you know you're going to see the person again agree things as the outer shelf of culture and this is one of the first challenges you will meet changing culture scientists which is not entirely true
